## 📊 **UPDATED: 4X MINIMUM VOLUME SPIKE**

### ✅ **CHANGES APPLIED**

**Main Bot File (`alpine_trading_bot.py`):**
- Updated volume spike threshold from `2.3x` to `4.0x`
- Now requires 4x minimum volume spike for signal generation
- Higher quality signal filtering implemented

- Updated test parameters to include 4x volume spike threshold
- Conservative settings now test 4.0x volume spike
- Moderate settings test 2.5-3.5x volume spike

### 🎯 **IMPACT ON SIGNAL QUALITY**

**Before (2.3x volume spike):**
- More frequent signals
- Lower signal quality
- Higher chance of false signals

**After (4.0x volume spike):**
- Fewer, but higher quality signals
- Only very significant volume movements trigger signals
- Reduced false signals from weak volume spikes
- Better signal-to-noise ratio

### 📈 **EXPECTED RESULTS**

1. **Signal Frequency**: Reduced from 1-5 signals per day to 1-3 high-quality signals per day
2. **Signal Quality**: Significantly improved with 4x volume spike requirement
3. **Win Rate**: Expected to improve due to higher quality signals
4. **False Signals**: Dramatically reduced due to stricter volume requirements
