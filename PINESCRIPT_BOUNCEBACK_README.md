# Pine Script Bounceback Zones Strategy

## Overview

This repository contains two Pine Script strategies designed to identify support and resistance levels with a focus on **bounceback zones** - areas where price is likely to reverse direction after touching key levels.

## Strategies Included

### 1. Basic Bounceback Strategy (`bounceback_zones_strategy.pine`)
- **Purpose**: Core bounceback detection using pivot points and volume analysis
- **Best For**: Beginners and those who prefer simple, clean signals
- **Key Features**:
  - Pivot point detection for support/resistance
  - Volume spike confirmation
  - RSI oversold/overbought levels
  - Moving average trend confirmation
  - Zone tolerance settings

### 2. Advanced Bounceback Strategy (`advanced_bounceback_strategy.pine`)
- **Purpose**: Multi-layered bounceback detection with enhanced confirmation
- **Best For**: Experienced traders seeking high-probability setups
- **Key Features**:
  - All basic features plus:
  - Fibonacci retracement levels
  - Psychological price levels
  - Multi-factor signal strength scoring
  - Price action pattern recognition
  - Enhanced risk management

## Key Features

### üîç **Multi-Level Detection**
- **Pivot Points**: Identifies swing highs and lows
- **Fibonacci Levels**: 23.6%, 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%, 78.6% retracements
- **Psychological Levels**: Round numbers and key price levels
- **Volume Analysis**: Confirms moves with volume spikes

### üìä **Signal Strength Scoring**
The advanced strategy uses a 5-point scoring system:
1. **Price at Level**: Base condition (1 point)
2. **RSI Confirmation**: Oversold/overbought conditions (1 point)
3. **Volume Spike**: Above-average volume (1 point)
4. **Price Action**: Candlestick patterns (1 point)
5. **Trend Alignment**: Moving average confirmation (1 point)

**Minimum Score**: 3 points required for signal generation

### üéØ **Bounceback Zone Logic**

#### Support Bounceback (Long Signals)
- Price touches support level
- RSI < 30 (oversold)
- Volume spike confirmation
- Bullish trend (fast MA > slow MA)
- Price action shows reversal patterns

#### Resistance Bounceback (Short Signals)
- Price touches resistance level
- RSI > 70 (overbought)
- Volume spike confirmation
- Bearish trend (fast MA < slow MA)
- Price action shows reversal patterns

## Installation & Usage

// Pivot Detection
pivot_length = 10          // Higher = fewer but stronger pivots
pivot_threshold = 0.5      // Minimum % move for pivot

// Volume Analysis
volume_threshold = 1.5     // Volume spike multiplier
volume_ma_length = 20      // Volume moving average period

// RSI Settings
rsi_oversold = 30         // Oversold level
rsi_overbought = 70       // Overbought level

// Zone Settings
zone_tolerance = 0.5      // % tolerance around levels
min_touches = 2           // Minimum touches to confirm zone
```

#### Advanced Strategy Settings
```pinescript
// Fibonacci Settings
fib_lookback = 100        // Bars to look back for swing points
use_fibonacci = true      // Enable/disable Fibonacci levels

// Psychological Levels
use_psychological = true   // Enable/disable psychological levels
round_to_nearest = 1.0    // Round to nearest price level
```
