---

## üö® PRE-REVIEW REQUIREMENTS

- [ ] **All tests pass locally**: Run `python -m pytest tests/ -v` 
- [ ] **Financial safety tests pass**: Run `python -m pytest tests/ -m financial_risk -v`
- [ ] **No security vulnerabilities**: Run `bandit -r . --severity-level medium`
- [ ] **Code formatting**: Run `black .` and `isort .`
- [ ] **Type checking**: Run `mypy . --ignore-missing-imports`

## üí∞ FINANCIAL LOGIC REVIEW

### Signal Generation Logic
- [ ] **RSI calculation accuracy**: Verify RSI thresholds and calculation method
- [ ] **Volume analysis correctness**: Check volume ratio calculations
- [ ] **Trend strength validation**: Ensure trend calculations are mathematically sound
- [ ] **Confidence calculation**: Verify confidence scores are bounded (0-100%)
- [ ] **Signal validation**: Check all required signal fields are present
- [ ] **Error handling**: Ensure invalid data doesn't generate false signals

### Position Sizing Calculations
- [ ] **Balance percentage limits**: Verify position sizing never exceeds safe percentage (11%)
- [ ] **Hard caps enforced**: Check maximum trade value limits ($19 cap)
- [ ] **Minimum trade validation**: Ensure minimum trade value ($5) is enforced
- [ ] **Leverage calculations**: Verify leverage is applied correctly (25x)
- [ ] **Precision handling**: Check calculations work with various price decimals
- [ ] **Edge case protection**: Test with zero, negative, or very small balances

### Trade Execution Safety
- [ ] **Order parameter validation**: Check symbol, side, amount, price are correct
- [ ] **Stop-loss accuracy**: Verify SL calculations (1.25% for both buy/sell)
- [ ] **Take-profit accuracy**: Verify TP calculations (1.5% for both buy/sell)
- [ ] **Order type correctness**: Market orders for entry, stop/limit for SL/TP
- [ ] **Exchange error handling**: Ensure API failures don't cause inconsistent state
- [ ] **Order status verification**: Check order fill status before placing SL/TP

## üîí SECURITY & SAFETY REVIEW

### API Security
- [ ] **No hardcoded credentials**: API keys must be in environment variables
- [ ] **Credential validation**: Check for proper API key format/length
- [ ] **Rate limiting**: Ensure API calls respect exchange limits
- [ ] **Error message sanitization**: No sensitive data in logs/errors

### Risk Management
- [ ] **Balance validation**: Check account balance before trading
- [ ] **Position limits**: Ensure total exposure doesn't exceed safe limits  
- [ ] **Emergency stops**: Verify emergency shutdown functionality
- [ ] **Logging security**: No sensitive data logged (API keys, personal info)

### Input Validation
- [ ] **Symbol validation**: Check trading pair format and existence
- [ ] **Price validation**: Ensure prices are positive and reasonable
- [ ] **Quantity validation**: Check quantities meet exchange minimums
- [ ] **Parameter bounds**: All configuration values within safe ranges

## üß™ TESTING REQUIREMENTS

### Unit Test Coverage
- [ ] **Signal generation tests**: All signal logic thoroughly tested
- [ ] **Position sizing tests**: All calculation scenarios covered
- [ ] **Trade execution tests**: All execution paths tested with mocks
- [ ] **Error handling tests**: All error conditions tested
- [ ] **Edge case tests**: Boundary conditions and extreme values tested

### Financial Safety Tests
- [ ] **Calculation accuracy**: Mathematical operations verified
- [ ] **Bounds checking**: All values stay within expected ranges
- [ ] **Risk limits**: Position sizing respects all risk parameters
- [ ] **Stop-loss verification**: SL/TP calculations prevent excessive losses

### Integration Tests
- [ ] **Mock exchange testing**: Full trading flow with mock exchanges
- [ ] **Error simulation**: Network errors, API failures, timeouts
- [ ] **Data validation**: Invalid market data handling
- [ ] **State consistency**: Bot state remains consistent across errors

## üìä CODE QUALITY REVIEW

### Code Structure
- [ ] **Function decomposition**: Complex logic broken into testable functions
- [ ] **Error handling**: Comprehensive try/catch blocks with proper logging
- [ ] **Type hints**: All function parameters and returns properly typed
- [ ] **Documentation**: Docstrings for all public functions
- [ ] **Constants**: No magic numbers, all values properly defined

### Performance
- [ ] **Memory usage**: No memory leaks or excessive memory consumption
- [ ] **API efficiency**: Minimal API calls, proper data caching
- [ ] **CPU usage**: No infinite loops or excessive computation
- [ ] **Async handling**: Proper async/await usage for I/O operations

### Maintainability
- [ ] **Code readability**: Clear variable names and function purposes
- [ ] **Configuration management**: All settings properly configurable
- [ ] **Logging consistency**: Appropriate log levels and messages
- [ ] **Version compatibility**: Code works with specified Python versions
